### My Observations About the Iris Dataset

**Dataset Overview:**
- Number of samples: [150]
- Number of features: [4]
- Number of classes: [3]

**Key Findings from the Visualization:**
1. [red dot = Setosa does not overlap with the other 2 classes]
2. [Setosa sepal length is higher then the 2 classes Virginica and versicolor]
3. [The minimum sepal length of virginica and verticolor started from 5cm while sepal length of setosa started from 3cm. ]

**Questions for Further Investigation:**
- [Why Iris Setosa does not overlap with the other 2 classes ?]
- [why the 2 sepal width of virginica and Versicolor overlaping ?]

**Reflection:**
*In 2-3 sentences, describe what you learned about using these tools.*

Using Bar chart allow us to easy visualize different form of comparing data and extract information. Numpy take care of calculation and allow numerical representation though Visualization.

My Observations About the Iris Dataset
Dataset Overview:

Number of samples: 150
Number of features: 4
Number of classes: 3
Key Findings from the Visualization:

Setosa grows widest out of the 3 classes. It is also the shortest out of the group.
Versicolor has the closeset data (closest average) compared to the other classes.
Virginica is the most scattered compared to the other classes. There are some anolmalies in it's data set that warrant further review.
Questions for Further Investigation:

Why is Virginica the most scattered class?
What does the other data tell us about why sometimes it grows long and other times it grows wide?

## My Observations About the Iris Dataset
**Dataset Overview:**
Number of samples: 150
Number of features: 4
Number of classes: 3

**Key Findings from the Visualization:**
[Write your observation about the scatter plot] Overall, sepal width of setosa is higher than the other 2 data.
[Write another observation] While sepal length of virginica is the highest one.
[Write a third observation] The data of red points is significantly different from the others.

**Questions for Further Investigation:**
[Write a question you'd like to explore] Why is the data of setosa seperate from the others?
[Write another question] Why is the data for versicolor and virginica not much different?

My Observations About the Iris Dataset

Dataset Overview:
Number of samples: 150
Number of features: 4
Number of classes: 3 (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
Key Findings from the Visualization:
The species setosa is very distinct and easily separated from the other two species based on petal measurements.
Versicolor and virginica overlap more in their features, making them visually harder to separate.
Petal length and petal width are the most valuable features for distinguishing between species.

Questions for Further Investigation:

Could a simple classifier (like logistic regression) achieve high accuracy with these features?
How well do the different machine learning algorithms handle the overlap between versicolor and virginica?

Reflection:
I learned how to utilize Python libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib, to explore datasets and visualize patterns. These tools facilitate the identification of useful features and potential challenges for machine learning. Working with Jupyter Notebook also showed me how to document my analysis clearly and professionally.
