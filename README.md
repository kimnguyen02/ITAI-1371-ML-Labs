### My Observations About the Iris Dataset

**Dataset Overview:**
- Number of samples: [150]
- Number of features: [4]
- Number of classes: [3]

**Key Findings from the Visualization:**
1. [red dot = Setosa does not overlap with the other 2 classes]
2. [Setosa sepal length is higher then the 2 classes Virginica and versicolor]
3. [The minimum sepal length of virginica and verticolor started from 5cm while sepal length of setosa started from 3cm. ]

**Questions for Further Investigation:**
- [Why Iris Setosa does not overlap with the other 2 classes ?]
- [why the 2 sepal width of virginica and Versicolor overlaping ?]

**Reflection:**
*In 2-3 sentences, describe what you learned about using these tools.*

Using Bar chart allow us to easy visualize different form of comparing data and extract information. Numpy take care of calculation and allow numerical representation though Visualization.
